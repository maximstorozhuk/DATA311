# Introduction

My name is **Maxim Storozhuk**, and I am a *3rd year* student who is majoring in **Computer Science**.

I play on the volleyball team here at UBCO, and I am looking to learn a lot about Machine Learning this semester! The best ice cream flavours are:

+ Birthday Cake
* Cookies & Cream
- Cookie Dough

Figure 1: My cat Timbit sitting on my homework.

```{r}
#| fig-height: 10 #will set figure height to 10
#| fig-width: 8 #will set figure width to 8
data <- read.csv("assignmentData/sales_data.csv") #data will be stored in the data variable

library(dplyr) #now we can use commands from tidyverse

str(data)
head(data)

data <- distinct(data) #removes duplicate rows

summary(data) #gives a summary of data, including displaying how many missing values there are

filtered_data <- filter(data, Store.Location == "New York") #filtered_data only contains sales made in New York

sorted_filtered <- arrange(filtered_data, desc(Total.Sales)) #sorted_filtered is now sorted in descending order by total sales, so the highest total sale is at index 1
print(paste("The highest total sale in New York was recorded on", sorted_filtered$Date[1])) #r indexes from 1 rather than 0

freq_table <- table(data$Payment.Method) # will have amount of times each payment method is used correspond with the payment method
most_used <- names(which.max(freq_table)) #most used payment method is stored in the most_used variable
print(paste("The most used payment method is", most_used)) #prints most used payment method

hist(data$Customer.Age, #creates a histogram of customer age
     main = "Customer Age Histogram", #sets histogram title to customer age histogram
     xlab = "Customer Age" #sets x-axis label to customer age
     )
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-scatterplot-quantity-price #labels the figure
#| fig-cap: Relationship Between Quantity and Price

plot(data$Quantity.Sold, data$Price, #creates a scatterplot of quantity vs price
     xlab = "Quantity Sold", #labels the x-axis
     ylab = "Price", #labels the y-axis
     pch = 16, #I don't like the default dots
     main = "Relationship Between Quantity and Price") #sets a title for the plot
```

We can see in Figure @fig-scatterplot-quantity-price that items that sell better tend to cost less. As quantity sold increases, price decreases.
